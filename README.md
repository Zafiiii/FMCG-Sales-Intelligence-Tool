# FMCG-Sales-Intelligence-Tool
Python-based automation tool for cleaning and visualizing FMCG distribution data. Developed to transform manual Excel workflows into data-driven insights.

### **The Problem I Solved**
Working in the FMCG sector for 6 years, I noticed a huge gap: we had massive amounts of sales data, but it was all handled manually in messy Excel sheets. This inspired me to teach myself Python and build a solution that turns raw numbers into a business strategy.

### **What This Tool Does**
- **Data Cleaning:** Automatically handles missing values and inconsistent formatting in distribution reports.
- **Revenue vs. Quantity Analysis:** Identifies which brands are actually profitable versus those that just have high volume.
- **Visual Dashboards:** Uses Matplotlib to generate trend graphs for monthly sales meetings.
- **Fuzzy Matching (In-Progress):** Cleaning unorganized shop names to group them into geographical territories.

### **Tech Stack**
- **Language:** Python (Developed in VS Code)
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib

### **Project Significance**
This project represents my transition from a Pre-Medical background to Data Science. It demonstrates my ability to identify business inefficiencies and solve them using computational logic.
